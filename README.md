This is a collection of C utils, functions, experiments, hacks, lerning attempts, and some copy-pasted code that I wanted to keep handy. I tried to identify the owners of the code but since this personal repository has been going on for years, I am certain I missed some.

If you see code taken from somewhere else that's not attributed to the proper author, please let me know!
